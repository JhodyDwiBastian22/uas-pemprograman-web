      <h3>CSS3 Styling</h3>
      <p>
        Having an understanding of HTML is not enough. Web designers must also have an understanding of CSS. CSS is a programming language that functions to regulate the entire appearance of a website so that it looks more attractive.
With CSS, web designers can set the text color, font, column size, spacing between paragraphs, and the desired type of background. Not only that, it even adds layouts and effects as needed.
CSS is often used in combination with HTML. For a full explanation, you can read the article Understanding CSS and How It Works to better understand it.
